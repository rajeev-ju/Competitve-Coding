Q:
  Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of 1 bits it has.

Example:

The 32-bit integer 11 has binary representation

00000000000000000000000000001011
so the function should return 3.

Note that since Java does not have unsigned int, use long for Java

Ans:
    class Solution {
    public:
        unsigned int numSetBits(unsigned int x) {
            unsigned int total_ones = 0;
            while (x != 0) {
                x = x & (x-1);
                total_ones++;
            }
            return total_ones;
        }
};
